My first ever web application I have created from scratch.

Demo: http://tburger.pythonanywhere.com/

Quizinger, as the name indicates is a quiz application. You can create, share and fill in quiz as you like.
I wanted a project as close to real-life as possible, so I asked a friend if he needs something to be developed and give me a brief that I can work with.

How it works:
To create a quiz you need to create an account.
The home screen will contain all the quizes created. If you need to create the first quiz, you can just click on 'Create New Quiz'.
You need to add a Quiz Name, which helps to identify your quiz.
Then you need to add a Quiz Title, which will be shown to the user as the name of the quiz.
There are three tiers for messages that you can show after the user is done with the quiz, based on their result. The lowest tier is from 0 to 40%, the middle is between 41% and 70%, the highest is from 71% to 100%.
The next step is to add a question. You can decide whether you want to add an image to the question or not. For each question there are four options that you need to provide. FIRST IS CORRECT? YOU CAN SELECT THE CORRECT?
If you want to add more questions to the quiz, just click 'Add Question', otherwise click 'End Quiz'.
If you made a mistake, you can Update each question, delete them, add new questions or delete the entire quiz.
If you would like to share the quiz with someone, you just need to click on the 'START QUIZ' button and then send them the URL.
